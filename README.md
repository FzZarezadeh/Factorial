# 🔢 Recursive Factorial Calculator – C# Console App

A simple C# console application that calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive method. This project demonstrates recursion, user input handling, and formatted console output.

📦 Features

- User Input:
  - Prompts the user to enter a number.
  - Repeats the process six times for multiple calculations.

- Recursive Factorial Logic:
  - Implements the classic recursive definition:
    `
    fact(n) = 1              if n == 1
    fact(n) = n * fact(n-1)  otherwise
    `

- Console Output:
  - Displays the factorial result for each entered number.
  - Waits for a key press before closing.
